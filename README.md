# TIBCO LABS™ Project GraphBuilder

Project GraphBuilder is a Flogo based tool set that includes a set of user extensions to build graph entities (nodes and edges) based on different formats of data and perform ‘CRUD’ operations in a graph database.

Using GraphBuilder you can build your own application to do the following: 
- Transform your data to the desired graph structure based upon an existing graph model.
- Insert graph data into any major graph database in the market (including TIBCO® Graph Database, Dgraph, Neo4j and JanusGraph).
- Query and delete graph data against TIBCO® Graph Database
