  In following hands on labs I will step by step guide you through the process of building an Flogo application which transforms csv data then inserts/updates data to TIBCO速 Graph Database. 
---

We are going to use the Northwind dataset to create an Flogo application. The Northwind data is a sample dataset used by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of Microsoft's relational database. We will demonstrate how to use GraphBuilder to convert relational data to graph then insert into TIBCO速 Graph Database.

You can check out or download Project GraphBuilder from <a href="https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/labs-graphbuilder-contrib" target="_blank">here</a> and the artifacts which you need for your labs project

- Download GraphBuilders user extensions <a href="https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/labs-graphbuilder-contrib/blob/master/dist" target="_blank">here</a>
- Download project data, graph model and TGDB configuration <a href="https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/labs-graphbuilder-contrib/blob/master/sample-applications/Northwind/" target="_blank">here</a>
- Sownload GUI utilities <a href="https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/labs-graphbuilder-contrib/blob/master/sample-applications/utilities/" target="_blank">here</a>

In the labs we use TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise studio to configure the lab applications. You need to have it installed before you can start building the application. You can get TIBCO Flogo速 Enterprise studio from <a href="https://edelivery.tibco.com/storefront/en/eval/tibco-flogo-enterprise/prod11810.html" target="_blank">here</a>

After installed studio import all required user extensions files (builder.zip, tgdb.zip, tools.zip and sse.zip)
1. In "Extensions" tab click "Upload" button
2. Click "From a Zip file"
3. Each time select one user extension (for example builder.zip) from your download folder
4. Click "Upload and compiling"

Keep uploading all other required extensions. Here is all four required user extensions
- GraphBuilder
- GraphBuilder_TGDB
- GraphBuilder_Tools
- GraphBuilder_SSE
