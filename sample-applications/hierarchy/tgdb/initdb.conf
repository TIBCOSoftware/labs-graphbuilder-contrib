# A segment is a physical file allocated on disk. It is specified in GBs.

# Data Segment. They manage data. User specify how many initial segments are needed.
# Index Segment. They contain indices for the data.
# Control Segment. Control Information about the other segments are written in this.
# Transaction Segment. Transaction Write-Ahead logs are maintained as part of the shared memory backed by file.
# Segment consists of multiple page. Each Page is of fixed size.
# The valids Page Sizes enumerated values are their interpretation is as follows. The units are in KB
# 0 => Use System Default Page size.
# 1 => 1KB (1024 Bytes)

# 8 => 8KB (8192 Bytes)

# The syscipher is used for creating a System-Wide Self Signed Database certificate.

# It can be obtained by running
# $> openssl -V ciphers
